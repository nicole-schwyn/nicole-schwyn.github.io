<p>Hi! My name is Nicole Schwyn.
    I am a <a href="https://www.oxy.edu/academics/areas-study/diplomacy-world-affairs">DWA major</a> at Occidental College (class of 2023).
    I am passionate primarily about human rights and gender rights within the inernational relations field, and
    I'm interested in going to law school in the future, and studying either international law and/or immigration law. </p>
<p>I speak two languages, English and Spanish, fluently, and am currently learning German. I love to travel to other countries,
especially Europe, since I have a Swiss passport. My dream is to one day be able to travel the world and maybe even live in another country.</p>
<p>Other than my interests in International Relations and travelling, I also enjoy trying new foods. One of my favorite things
is trying the local cuisine of a country. Nothing beats eating the local food of a country.</p>
